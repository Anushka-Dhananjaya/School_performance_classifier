# School_performance_classifier
KNN Classifier for predicting school performance based on various features.

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify the performance of schools based on various features. The primary focus is on using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, but other models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes are also considered and evaluated. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and recommendations for future improvements.
